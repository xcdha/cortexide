# CortexIDE smoke harness

Lightweight launch + smoke verification for the CortexIDE dev build, driven over the
Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). Used to confirm the editor actually boots and its core
+ CortexIDE-specific UI render — see `../../CORTEXIDE-TEST-STATUS.md` for results.

## Files
- `launch-dev.sh` — launches the built dev app (`.build/electron/...`) with
  `--remote-debugging-port`, stripping the inherited `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` that
  otherwise makes Electron run as plain Node. Uses throwaway user-data/extensions dirs.
- `cdp-smoke.mjs` — connects with Playwright `connectOverCDP`, finds the workbench page
  (`workbench-dev.html` in dev builds), and asserts core + CortexIDE surfaces exist.

## Usage
```bash
# (rebuild React UI only if you touched browser/react/src/*.tsx)
npm run buildreact

# Terminal A — launch and leave running:
test/cortexide-smoke/launch-dev.sh 9222 /tmp/cx-ws-cdp

# Terminal B — run the smoke test:
node test/cortexide-smoke/cdp-smoke.mjs --port 9222
```
Exit code 0 = all checks passed. A screenshot is written to the OS temp dir.

## Why CDP and not Playwright `_electron.launch()`
VS Code / CortexIDE manages its own (re)launching, so Playwright's stdout-handshake
Electron launcher fails with "Process failed to launch!". Launching the app ourselves
with a debug port and attaching over CDP is the supported path (mirrors upstream VS Code
`test/automation`). Note: once a debugger is attached to a page, `/json/list` may drop
that page's `webSocketDebuggerUrl`; Playwright's `connectOverCDP` handles this, a hand-
rolled raw-WebSocket client does not — so prefer `cdp-smoke.mjs`.
